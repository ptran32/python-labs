# ----------- Personal Note ----------- #
=======
in Alien Invasion, the player control a ship that appears at the bottom of the center.
The player can move right and left using the arrow keys and shoot bullets using the spacebar.

When the game begins, a fleet of aliens fills the sky and move across and down the screen.
The player shoots and destroys the aliens.
If the player shoots all the alien, a new fleet appears that move faster than the previous one.

If any alien hits the ship or reach the bottom of the screen, the player looses a ship.
If player looses 3 ships, he looses.
